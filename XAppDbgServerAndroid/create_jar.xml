  This ant script can be used to package the compiled framework classes
  into a jar, which can be then added to the widget projects.

  * Execute this script, which will generate a file called AdvWidgetFwk.jar
  * Copy the jar file to the widget project's "libs/" folder

  No extra steps are needed, since semc-build will automatically include
  all jar files from the libs folder.
